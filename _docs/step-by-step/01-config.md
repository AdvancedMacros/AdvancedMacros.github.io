If you want to make your scripts available to multiple instances of Minecraft,
you should edit the mod's config to change where AM's root folder goes.


Once you have the game up you should make sure there are no key confllicts with AM's keybind (`L` by default).
<div class="note">In newer versions of MC <code>L</code> is also the <code>Advancements</code> key. Personally I move advancements to <code>;</code> and keep AM on <code>L</code> for Lua</div>
