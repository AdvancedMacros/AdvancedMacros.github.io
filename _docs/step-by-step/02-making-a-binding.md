Press your `Advanced Macros menu` key and you should be greeted with a screen that looks something like this this:

Click ![+Binding button](/assets/img/newBindingButton.png)


Then you'll see something this:
![Binding](/assets/img/binding.png)

| Buttons | Purpose               |
|:--------|:----------------------|
| 1       | Remove binding        |
| 2       | Enable / Disable      |
| 3       | Binding type          |
| 4       | Select trigger        |
| 5       | Select script         |
| 6       | Edit selected script  |
| 7       | Move binding          |

For now we'll start by selecting a key to trigger the script.
Click `Button 4` and then press any key on your keyboard (preferably something that doesn't already have a binding)
